## Description

Daily Planner/ Work Day Scheduler is an application that allows the user to enter delete and save appointments or plans on their schedule. This programs aid the user in their workday schedule to keep track of their tasks in lieu of their current time to have a more productive day. By creating this application I was able to apply my knowledge in jQuery, jQuery UI, Bootstrap, and Moment.js.
